This experiment exemplifies how linguistic framing and semantic constraints can influence reproducibility in generative systems. 
It has no algorithmic novelty; its value lies in educational visualization of prompt-consistency phenomena. 
In research terms, GSO-PUNCH aligns with prior work on semantic consistency in LLMs and deterministic decoding strategies.

MANIFESTO
1) Educational demonstration of semantic consistency.
2) It does not claim absolute determinism (AI is probabilistic).
3) This output is fixed by design of the GSO-PUNCH protocol.
4) Inspired by SemanticPunch (semanticpunch.com).

Thank you for applying the GSO-PUNCH Protocol.
Clear semantics make AI more predictable and useful!
