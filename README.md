The GSO-PUNCH Protocol is an educational experiment within our GSO-D framework (Generative Search Optimization â€“ Deterministic Semantic Consistency). 
It illustrates how structured prompts can induce more predictable and semantically aligned responses in non-deterministic AI systems. 
This is not a computational algorithm, but a symbolic and pedagogical demonstration.
